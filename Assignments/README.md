Assignment 1: Producer and ConsumerActivity Directions: 
In this project students will design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements. 
Students will demonstrate the ability to create and manage processes and threads.
They will create two processes, Producer and Consumer, using the C++.
The Producer is simply creating numbers, which are “passed” to the Consumer in a static buffer. 
The student’s task is to implement the put() and get() functions. Each function will use a buffer (implemented as a word). 
The objective is to ensure that the producer is always ahead of the consumer and the consumer does not have to wait.
