# PROJECT 1: Unix/Linux Command Line Interpreter <br>
------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Command Line Interpreter Program!

There are some of the important features and instructions to follow.

This program is designed to perform command line interpreter with a mini user interface.

You can run the program by running a cpp file. Once the cpp file is running,

it will generate the executable file (first time only!).

User can play with the executable file once it is generated.

1) you can quit the program by typing 'quit' or manually press ctrl+c
- When the program is running, you can type 'quit' from any stage and terminate.

2) type 'run' from the first stage if you want to work with the command line interpreter
- When the program is running, it will ask a user either type 'run' or 'quit'.
- You have to type 'run' to work with a command line

3) cd command is not working
- I explained why cd command is not working within the documentation, however, there are 
- more than 5 commands that you can work with. It is within the documentation as well.
ex. ls, pwd, ps, cat, touch, nano, etc...

4) Within the running stage, there are four options
--- 1. run a command line : type any command line
--- 2. create a file ('batch') : type 'batch' to create a file and follow the direction of the prompt
--- 3. running a file ('file') : type 'file' to read a file and follow the direction of the prompt
--- 4. terminate the program ('quit')

Detail of the program is within the Project 1 documentation.
